_Recently I made a start with Kubernetes and I found out there's a lot of commands available through the `kubectl` CLI. It took me some time to search through the available commands and flags to find the ones that helped me. I combined them in a cheatsheet, so this saves me (and maybe you) also some time in searching through the manual._

## Pointing kubectl to a cluster and namespace

At first it was a bit magic how kubectl knows how to connect to a cluster and to which cluster it was connected, since I didn't configure these. For example when using [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) you run `kind create cluster` and afterwards your `kubectl` commands magicaly point to the cluster. What is happening under the hood, is that Kind writes the connection details to `~/.kube/config` and selects it to be used by kubectl. Switching between namespaces within a cluster happens in a similar way:

```zsh
# View configuration of all clusters known to kubectl
➜  cat ~/.kube/config
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    ...
contexts:
- context:
    ...
current-context: ...
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: ...
  user: {}
# or
➜  kubectl config view
... same output as previous command ...

# Switching kubectl to point to a different cluster
➜  kubectl config set-context name_of_cluster

# View selected namespace
➜  kubectl config view | grep namespace

# Switching namespace
➜  kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=default  
```

## Current state of the cluster

To get to know more about the current state of the cluster I often cycle between these three commands: `get`, `describe` and `logs`:

```zsh
# Get all resources in all namespaces using -A
➜  kubectl get all,cm,secret,ing -A

# Watch current state of pods using -w, which allows you to see realtime what is happening
➜  kubectl get pods -w

# Get information about the state of a pod
# When the pod doesn't start, this is the place where you can find the reason
➜  kubectl describe my_pod

# Follow the logs of the my_container in the my_pod using -f
➜  kubectl logs my_pod my_container -f

# Secrets are base64 encoded, and thus are NOT actually secret
# You can view them as follows:
➜  kubectl get secret my_secret -o jsonpath="{.data.my_field_with_secret_value}" | base64 --decode
```

I prefer to use the CLI over a GUI, since it allows you to better understand how things work and you can easily write scripts to automate things. Still using a GUI makes things easier, especially if you work daily with Kubernetes. For this [Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) is a nice tool.

## Managing the state of the cluster

Some more tricks to make changes to the cluster or dive further into it:

```zsh
# Pods exist of containers, so you can do something similar to 'docker exec'
➜  kubectl exec my_pod --stdin --tty -c my_container -- /bin/bash

# If a deployment failed or some resource it used has changed, you can roll it out again
➜  kubectl rollout restart deployment my_deployment
```

When I use Kind I'm often debugging and figuring out things. To make this easier, a VS Code extension can be used to attach a VS Code instance to containers of a pod. This makes it a lot easier when you have to change files while only Vim is installed.

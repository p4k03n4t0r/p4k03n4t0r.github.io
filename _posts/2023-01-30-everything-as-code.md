_Everything as code (or scaffolding advanced)_

Project structure as code (linting, prettier, depedency management, pipeline)
Infrastructure as code
Contracts as code (API's)
Security as code
-> Support to automate everything

A pain to set up, requires skilled developers to take the lead
Should support extensibility, not force the user into a specific solution/direction
Gives power to the organisation

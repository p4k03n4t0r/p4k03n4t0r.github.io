_Recently I and a collegue were trying to set up dualboot on a laptop, so the laptop would have Ubuntu besides the already installed Windows. The Windows had BitLocker installed, which prevented Ubuntu from being installed. After struggling quite a bit, we got it working in the end. Still for me the question remained: how do disks actually work? Somehow files in my filesystem are translated to zeros and ones and put onto the disk, but this always was a bit magic for me._

## TLDR

The overview:

## What are partitions, volumes, drives, disks and file systems?

I've used different tools like [GParted](https://gparted.org/) and `df` in combination with searching on the internet to make changes to my disks. For example if I wanted to use the extra disk space assigned to my Ubuntu HyperV VM. A lot of terms come along, which I couldn't clearly distinguish. I looked at each of them and came up with the following definitions:

* **Drive:** A physical storage device, which could be a HDD (Hard Disk Drives) or SSD (Solid State Drive), but also an USB (Universal Serial Bus) and CD (Compact Disc).
* **Disks:** It seems the difference between disk and drive is not as relevant anymore as it used to be. HDD's are a drive which can hold multiple disks, but in modern storage devices, like SSD and USB, there are no disks anymore. More info can be found [here](https://superuser.com/a/341501). What can be said for sure is that drive and disk are physical devices.
* **Partition:** Is a chunk of a disk with a specific size.
* **Volume:** Often a partition is also a Volume, but this isn't always the case. 
* **File system:** A way to store data on the volume, where each volume can their own file system.
